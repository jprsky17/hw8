5.) If you knock out this gene, what is your expected phenotype?

This gene is downregulated following acute deafferentation injury. If this gene was knocked out via gene editing with crisper potential effects could hypothetically mirror the effect of such an injury potentially causing reduced dendritic complexity withing neuronal tissue.
